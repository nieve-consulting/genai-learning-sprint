    "Prompt engineering is not just about crafting a request to a language model; it's about doing so in a way that the model can understand and respond to effectively. The quality of the prompt can greatly influence the quality of the output. Here, we'll look at some characteristics of good and bad prompts and see examples of each.\n",
    "Characteristics of Good Prompts: Clear and Specific: Good prompts provide clear instructions or questions that are directly related to the desired output. Contextually Rich: They provide enough context to guide the model in the direction of the expected response. Balanced Detail: They include just the right amount of detail—enough to direct the model without over-constraining its responses. Aligned With Model's Training: They are aligned with the type of content and format the model was trained on. Characteristics of Bad Prompts: Vague or Ambiguous: Bad prompts are unclear, which can lead to irrelevant or off-topic responses from the model. Lacking Context: Without context, the model may not understand the prompt's intent or may provide generic answers. Overly Detailed or Restrictive: Prompts that are too specific may limit the model's ability to generate creative or comprehensive responses. Mismatched to Model's Training: Using a style or requesting information that the model wasn't trained on can result in poor performance."
