**4.** Which of the following is true about discriminative models?

- [ ] They focus on predicting the target variable directly.
- [ ] They model the joint probability distribution of input features and target variables.
- [ ] They are mainly used for generating new data.
- [ ] They are less accurate compared to generative models.

**5.** Supervised learning involves:

- [ ] Learning without any labeled data
- [ ] Learning a function that maps inputs to outputs using labeled data
- [ ] Clustering data into groups
- [ ] Learning to maximize rewards over time

**6.** Which learning paradigm is best suited for discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled data?

- [ ] Supervised Learning
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning

**7.** What is the purpose of cross-validation in the context of Machine Learning?

- [ ] To estimate model performance on unseen data
- [ ] To increase the size of the training dataset
- [ ] To ensure that the model is free of errors
- [ ] To speed up the training process

**8.** In the Bias-Variance Tradeoff, what does overfitting refer to?

- [ ] The model captures the true underlying patterns of the data.
- [ ] The model captures noise instead of the underlying patterns.
- [ ] The model is too simple and fails to capture the complexity of the data.
- [ ] The model generalizes well to unseen data.

**9.** Which type of Machine Learning model is used for tasks like data generation and missing data imputation?
