- [ ] To estimate model performance on unseen data
- [ ] To increase the size of the training dataset
- [ ] To ensure that the model is free of errors
- [ ] To speed up the training process

**8.** In the Bias-Variance Tradeoff, what does overfitting refer to?

- [ ] The model captures the true underlying patterns of the data.
- [ ] The model captures noise instead of the underlying patterns.
- [ ] The model is too simple and fails to capture the complexity of the data.

- [ ] Accuracy
- [ ] Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- [ ] Precision
- [ ] R-Squared

**11.** What is a key characteristic of unsupervised learning?

- [ ] It requires labeled data for training.
- [ ] It uses reward signals to guide learning.
- [ ] It automatically finds patterns and structure in data.
- [ ] It predicts future values based on historical data.

**12.** What does the term "regularization" refer to in Machine Learning?

- [ ] A technique used to increase the accuracy of a model on the training data
- [ ] A method to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function
- [ ] The process of dividing the dataset into training and test sets
- [ ] A method to handle missing data in a dataset

**13.** In reinforcement learning, what is the role of the "reward function"?

- [ ] It generates new data points for training.
- [ ] It evaluates the quality of the predictions made by the model.
- [ ] It provides feedback to the agent, guiding its learning process.
- [ ] It measures the accuracy of the model's predictions.

**14.** Which evaluation metric is most appropriate for imbalanced classification problems?

- [ ] F1 Score
- [ ] Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- [ ] R-Squared
