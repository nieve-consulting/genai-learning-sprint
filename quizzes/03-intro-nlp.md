**1.** What is the primary goal of Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

- [ ] To create new languages
- [ ] To simulate human intelligence
- [ ] To enable computers to understand and generate human language
- [ ] To process numerical data

**2.** Why is it important to preprocess text data before modeling in NLP?

- [ ] To increase the size of the dataset
- [ ] To remove unnecessary information and standardize the text, ensuring better model performance
- [ ] To add complexity to the data for advanced modeling
- [ ] To avoid overfitting the model on the training data

**3.** What is the main purpose of tokenization in text preprocessing?

- [ ] To translate text from one language to another
- [ ] To break down text into smaller units like words or subwords
- [ ] To classify text into different categories
- [ ] To generate a summary of a text

**4.** In NLP, what does the Bag-of-Words model ignore when representing text?

- [ ] The frequency of words
- [ ] The order of words
- [ ] The length of the document
- [ ] The semantic meaning of words

**5.** Which method is used to reduce words to their base form in text preprocessing?

- [ ] Tokenization
- [ ] Lemmatization
- [ ] Stopword Removal
- [ ] Text Summarization

**6.** What is the key difference between static and contextual word embeddings?

- [ ] Static embeddings are generated on-the-fly, while contextual embeddings are pre-trained
- [ ] Static embeddings capture context, while contextual embeddings do not
- [ ] Contextual embeddings change based on word context, while static embeddings remain fixed
- [ ] Contextual embeddings are used for image processing, while static embeddings are used for text

**7.** Which NLP task would you use to identify and categorize names, locations, and organizations within a text?

- [ ] Sentiment Analysis
- [ ] Named Entity Recognition
- [ ] Part-of-Speech Tagging

**10.** What is the role of a language model in NLP?

- [ ] To classify text into categories
- [ ] To generate answers to questions
- [ ] To predict the next word in a sequence
- [ ] To translate text between languages

**11.** Which NLP technique is used to capture local context by considering sequences of words like bigrams or trigrams?

- [ ] Tokenization
- [ ] N-grams
- [ ] Stopword Removal
- [ ] Named Entity Recognition

**12.** What kind of text data representation is most suitable for capturing semantic meaning in continuous vector space?

- [ ] Sequence Data

**13.** Which modeling approach in NLP relies on predefined rules to process text?

- [ ] Rule-Based Systems
- [ ] Deep Learning Models
- [ ] Statistical Models
- [ ] Machine Learning Models

**14.** In the NLP pipeline, what is the purpose of sentence segmentation?

- [ ] To assign grammatical tags to words
- [ ] To remove irrelevant words
